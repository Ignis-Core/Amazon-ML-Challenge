# 🚀 Amazon ML Challenge 2025 | Smart Product Pricing

From October 11th to 13th, 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to lead Team Data Drama in the *Amazon ML Challenge 2025* — an exciting experience that tested our problem-solving, collaboration, and machine learning skills under real-world constraints.

🧠 Challenge Overview
The task was to build an ML model capable of predicting optimal product prices using catalog text and image data, tackling complexities found in real-world e-commerce pricing systems.

🔍 Our Approach
- Processed and cleaned 75K+ product entries
- Extracted textual and visual features from catalog data
- Applied TF-IDF (word & character n-grams) for rich text representation
- Built and fine-tuned a LightGBM regression model optimized for limited CPU resources
- Used log1p transformation to handle skewed price distributions
- Evaluated model performance using SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

📈 Results
Despite a tight 72-hour timeline and hardware constraints, our model achieved a  
Final SMAPE of 53.20% (~46.8% estimated accuracy) — a strong result for a CPU-only approach.

🧩 Learnings
This challenge was an incredible experience in:
- Feature engineering  
- Model optimization  
- Leading a technical team under pressure
